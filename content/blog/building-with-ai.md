# Building My Portfolio with AI Assistance

Vibe coding is redefining how people code. Imagine a super smart code assistant that guide you in your coding journey. 
With a few simple instructions in natural languages, it can create whatever you want, no need to study for years or 
working hard to learn by doing, everything working with no errors out of the box... If this sounds a bit strange and 
unrealistic, is because it is unrealistic. 

Am I starting the post of how I designed this web portfolio vibe coding, criticizing vibe coding? Yes, I am.

## Vibe coding or the new copy-pasting?

This isn't new. Everyone has searched for an easy solution on stackoverflow and copied the first comment. But nothing 
is that easy in real life. 

Using the stack overflow simil, maybe an AI can solve a puntual problem, but it can't build a hole system. And if used 
without knowledge, it can generate new errors.

## The good part of vibe-coding

However, not everything is bad. This web page was created using copilot, without any knowledge of react. Is it well coded? no.
Is it secure? no. But it is a little project that doesn't need it, a fast prototype for a futture true project.

This was done trying several AI options, investigating how they work, and learning specific tools like prompt engineering. 
And also having knowledge about deployment in github pages, basic frontend and general coding.

## Final words

Is it vibe-coding the devil? No, it's not. But I don't think is a magic wand that translates your desires into code.
Vibe-coding is a tool, and a very good one. But, as every tool, it needs a learning process. 

As everything arrownd AI, it will power up good developers, but will do no good to mediocre ones.

Lets continue learning.
